## Running with HTTPS

Normally you would run `npm start` (or `sudo npm start` on Mac) to launch the application. This will launch webpack-dev-server bind to port 80. If you wish to start the server with https enabled, simply pass the `--https` flag as an argument:

```sh
$ npm start -- --https 
```

If you always need https, then you can edit the `package.json` file and add the `--https` flag to the _start script_, like so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack-dev-server --hot --https",
  }
}
  
```

### `npm run tdd` or `yarn tdd`

By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
